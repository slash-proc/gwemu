/*
 * STM32H7B0 FLASH_R (embedded flash controller registers)
 *
 * Started as an auto-generated register-only stub; upgraded to a real
 * device for sector-erase side effects -- see gnw_h7b0_flash_r.c for why:
 * gnwmanager's `erase` command finished suspiciously instantly and left
 * flash content completely unchanged. The register stub had no
 * connection at all to the actual flash_bank1/flash_bank2 RAM regions, so
 * writing FLASH_CR1/CR2's SER+SNB+START bits (what HAL_FLASHEx_Erase()
 * actually does to erase a sector on real hardware) only ever changed the
 * register's own stored value -- the guest-visible flash memory itself
 * never got touched. Real hardware's flash controller autonomously wipes
 * the target sector to 0xFF as a hardware side effect of that bit
 * sequence; program (HAL_FLASH_Program) doesn't have this problem since
 * it does a direct CPU write to the memory-mapped flash address, bypassing
 * FLASH_R registers for the actual data movement entirely.
