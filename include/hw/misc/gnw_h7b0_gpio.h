/*
 * STM32H7B0 GPIO minimal stub (Nintendo Game & Watch)
 *
 * Not a real pin/electrical model -- no MODER-driven input/output
 * behavior, no ODR->IDR loopback for pins configured as outputs, no
 * button/LCD control-line side effects. Every register in every port
 * (A-K, 0x400 each) is a plain read/write shadow, *except* that IDR
 * (offset 0x10 within each port) resets to all-1s instead of the
 * generic RAM placeholder's all-0s.
 *
 * That one bit of behavior matters a lot: real G&W buttons are
 * active-low with external pull-ups (see gnw-chainloader's
 * board_check_button(): `(port->IDR & pin) == 0` means pressed), so a
 * zero-initialized IDR reads as "every button held" forever. This was
 * the previous plain-RAM GPIO placeholder's behavior, and it silently
 * forced gnw-chainloader's main.c app_early_logic() "God Mode" path
 * (hold_left || hold_right) on every single boot -- not a real
 * button press, not a QEMU input event, just an unpressed button
 * reading as pressed. Found by the user noticing gnw-chainloader
 * jumping straight to a "FLASHING..." OFW-install screen it had no
 * business reaching un-prompted, after gnw_h7b0_crc.c's real CRC unit
 * let that code path's checksum actually pass instead of failing
 * closed. Defaulting IDR high fixes the false-positive without
 * needing any real button-input plumbing yet.
 *
 * Button input plumbing (added this session): registers a
 * QemuInputHandler covering both keyboard and pointer-button events
 * and clears/sets the mapped port's IDR bit on press/release, per
 * board_check_button()'s `(port->IDR & pin) == 0` == pressed polarity.
 * See gnw_h7b0_gpio.c for the button->pin table and the keyboard/
 * pointer-button mapping, and its rationale comment for why "gamepad"
 * support here is best-effort: QEMU v9.2 (this project's pinned base)
 * has no SDL2 game-controller/joystick backend, so InputButton in this
 * tree is a mouse-button enum only -- there is no code path by which a
 * real xpad-style controller's face buttons reach a QEMU device today.
