/*
 * STM32H7B0 RTC minimal stub (Nintendo Game & Watch)
 *
 * Calendar and Alarm A behavior needed by firmware; not cycle-accurate.
 * Purpose: real
 * firmware's HAL_RTC_Init() -> RTC_EnterInitMode() writes ICSR.INIT
 * (bit 7) then polls ICSR.INITF (bit 6) for real hardware to confirm
 * entry into initialization mode, and RTC_ExitInitMode() ->
 * HAL_RTC_WaitForSynchro() then polls ICSR.RSF (bit 5) for the shadow
 * registers to resync -- both bounded-timeout HAL polls that must not
 * time out, or HAL_RTC_Init() returns HAL_TIMEOUT and firmware treats
 * that as fatal (retro-go's Error_Handler()/BSOD, traced via
 * gnw-chainloader/retro-go-sd's Core/Src/main.c MX_RTC_Init()). This
 * was a plain zero-initialized RAM placeholder through Phase 1 (see
 * STATUS.md); INITF/RSF never reading back set is exactly this
 * timeout. Every ICSR write instantly mirrors INITF|RSF|INITS set
 * (same "instant approximation" pattern as RCC/PWR/OSPI/ADC's
 * ON->RDY bits) so the poll never blocks.
 *
 * Alarms A and B run from QEMU_CLOCK_VIRTUAL. Their calendar fields and masks
 * select the next matching second. SCR clears their SR flags, MISR gates them
 * with CR.ALRAIE/ALRBIE, and the shared alarm output drives RTC_Alarm_IRQn.
 * The wakeup counter also runs from virtual time and updates WUTF/MISR. The
 * second device output carries WUTF gated by CR.WUTIE into EXTI line 19;
 * EXTI owns its mask, pending flag, and dedicated RTC_WKUP_IRQn output.
 *
 * TR/DR (time/date) are a ticking calendar, seeded from the host's
 * local time at reset by default and advanced via QEMU_CLOCK_VIRTUAL
 * (see gnw_h7b0_rtc_sync_calendar()/_reanchor_calendar() in the .c
 * file). The SoC overrides that default with Unix epoch 0 in timing mode.
 * The `initial-epoch` property can instead select a deterministic nonnegative
 * Unix epoch, displayed as UTC. The standard QEMU `-rtc base`
 * option is not consumed by this device. This was added because the
 * gnw-chainloader has a real clock display
 * that reads TR/DR and a static/stub value looked obviously wrong. A
 * write to either re-anchors the running calendar to the new value
 * (in case firmware ever sets the clock), but no tested firmware image
 * actually does that -- they only read it.
 *
 * SSR (the synchronous prescaler's sub-second down-counter) is derived
 * from the same calendar, using the programmed PRER.PREDIV_S, and
 * SSR/TR/DR reads take the hardware's shadow-register lock so the three
 * are always a coherent snapshot -- both in gnw_h7b0_rtc_read()/
 * _sync_calendar(). It has to be real, not a shadow: a constant SSR
 * makes the HAL's (PREDIV_S - SSR)/(PREDIV_S + 1) fraction constant
 * too, which silently freezes tv_usec for every
 * GW_GetCurrentMillis()/_gettimeofday() caller.
 *
 * Every other register (WPR, CALR, SHIFTR, timestamp and CFGR) is a plain
 * read/write shadow with no side effects.
