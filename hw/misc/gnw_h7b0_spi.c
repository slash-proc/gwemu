 * TXDR completion used to be deferred by a small QEMUTimer-paced delay

 * (SD_ReadyWait()/SD_RxDataBlock()/SD_SendCmd()) spinning through far
 * more iterations per wall-clock timeout window than real hardware could
 * (confirmed via live profiling: ~23,000 SPI1 register writes/sec during
 * ordinary SD-card gameplay reads, since instant completion meant each
 * "byte" cost only a few emulated instructions). That approach caused a
 * real regression -- a full guest hang, confirmed via live PC-sampling
 * (frozen in HAL_Delay, forward progress only resumed once completion
 * was reverted to synchronous) -- almost certainly because retro-go-sd's
 * poll loop here is tight enough that TCG never yields back to QEMU's
 * main loop to service the pending completion timer, so the guest spins
 * forever waiting on a flag that can only ever be set from a timer
 * callback it's preventing from running. Reverted to synchronous
 * completion (matching this file's original, working behavior) --
 * correctness/not-hanging trumps the CPU-usage optimization. If revisited,
 * needs a pacing strategy that doesn't require the guest CPU to yield
 * control on every single byte (e.g. block-level pacing instead of
 * per-byte, or a mechanism proven not to starve under a tight poll loop).

 * falling back to the polled path above only after a 100ms timeout plus
 * an abort. With no DMA modelling at all that timeout was paid on every
 * single sector (~0.5 reads/sec, nothing booted).
 *
 * The DMA controller here never moves peripheral data itself -- each
 * consumer pulls from M0AR/NDTR in its own stream notifier (same as
 * gnw_h7b0_sai1.c and gnw_h7b0_hash.c). So the RX notifier below does
 * the real SSI byte exchange for both directions, sourcing the outgoing
 * bytes from the TX stream's buffer; the TX notifier exists only so the
 * TX stream gets the same request-activity gating and its TCIF is
 * latched (HAL_DMA_IRQHandler needs it to return hdmatx to READY).
