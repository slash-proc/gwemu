/*
 * Nintendo Game & Watch (STM32H7B0) Machine Model
 *
 * Phase 1: instantiates gnw-h7b0-soc (real SRAM bank layout + internal/
 * external flash regions, no peripherals yet) and loads a kernel image
 * into flash bank 1 at 0x08000000, matching real hardware's boot path
 * (BOOT_ADD option-byte remap on cold boot, or a debug probe's VTOR/SP/
 * PC direct-set on the gnwmanager dev flow -- see gnw_h7b0_soc.c's
 * init-svtor comment) and where retro-go's own linker script places
 * .isr_vector. See ../../docs/roadmap.md.

/*
 * Was 280MHz (the datasheet's stated max) as a placeholder guess -- but
 * retro-go's actual PLL1 configuration (RCC->PLLCKSELR/PLLCFGR/
 * PLL1DIVR, decoded by HAL_RCC_GetSysClockFreq()) computes to
 * 340512000 Hz exactly, confirmed by reading SystemCoreClock live
 * out of guest RAM after boot. Since our RCC model is a plain
 * register shadow (no real PLL lock/frequency modeling -- see
 * gnw_h7b0_rcc.c), firmware's own clock-derived timing (SysTick reload,
 * frame-pacing math in Core/Src/porting/common.c's
 * frame_integrator/get_elapsed_time()) only comes out correct if this
 * Clock's rate actually matches what firmware computed it configured
 * PLL1 to. Using 280MHz here made every SysTick/HAL_GetTick()-based
 * measurement run at 280/340.5 =~ 82% of the real elapsed-time rate,
 * which made retro-go's frame_integrator perpetually think less time
 * had passed than really had, believing (from ITS perspective, based
 * on this now-provably-wrong clock) that emulation was running faster
 * than intended -- permanently latching common_emu_state.pause_frames
 * at 1. That's what was producing "runs too fast/stuttery" gameplay
 * and, audibly, corrupted retro-go audio: pause_frames=1 makes
 * common_emu_sound_sync() wait for two DMA half-transfer ticks per
 * call instead of one, while the per-core sound_submit() (e.g.
 * gwenesis_sound_submit()) still only refills whichever ONE audio
 * buffer half is active when it finally runs, permanently starving
 * the other -- audible as pitch/rate distortion and stuck-tone
 * "ripping" artifacts smeared into otherwise-normal audio.
